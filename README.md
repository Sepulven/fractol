## Description 

The first fractal historically studied was the Mandelbrot set, introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980.
This concept arose from the realization that many natural phenomena cannot be adequately described by Euclidean
Geometry. The mandelbrot set, and its formula variations, are generated by iteratively applying a simple function
with a specific formula to poinst on a complex plane until we've applied the formula to the visible plane.

Explore the mesmerizing universe of fractals through this interactive project, 'Fract-ol'.
This dynamic program offers various varieties of the Mandelbrot set, for example:

### 1. Mandelbrot

## How to play with it:
  1. You are going to need to be in a linux system, prefeably a debian distribution. In my case I used Ubuntu.
  I don't how would be possible to make it work with other linux distributions.

  2. Clone this repository
  3. __cd__ to the cloned repository and then clone the repository of the library.
     
     Link: [git@github.com:42Paris/minilibx-linux.git](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)

  5. __cd__ to the Minilibx and then run __make__
  6. __cd_ __..__ and then run make
     If every aspect is correct it should work as expected and you're going to have the ./fractol created.
  7. To play with it run __./fractol__ and follow the prompt.
